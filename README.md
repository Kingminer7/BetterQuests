# BetterQuests is no longer being updated, and will not update to the next version of Geometry Dash.

### Why?

I haven't been too happy with the way I've managed the mod overall.
- I haven't been actively updating anything server side, like adding new quests or similar.
- The project itself is messy for both the server and mod.
- The server setup I have is not good for the features I had planned and the system I was aiming for.

I'm sorry for the poor management the mod has recieved.

# BetterQuests

Adds a new quest system to the game. There are different difficulties, and quests reward scrolls. Scrolls are a new stat that're just visual.
